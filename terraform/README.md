## Detailed Recommendations

**
*   **Containerize Application:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the Django application. Include Python, Django dependencies, a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn), and configure it to run the application. Build this image and push it to AWS ECR.
*   **Networking (VPC):** Deploy into a custom AWS VPC with both public and private subnets across at least two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
    *   Place internet-facing resources like the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and NAT Gateways in public subnets.
    *   Place application containers (ECS Tasks) and the RDS database in private subnets for enhanced security.
*   **Compute (ECS Fargate):** Use AWS ECS with the Fargate launch type. Fargate manages the underlying infrastructure, simplifying operations and scaling. Configure an ECS Service with auto-scaling based on CPU and/or memory utilization to meet demand and optimize costs.
*   **Database (RDS):** Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL with the Multi-AZ deployment option enabled. This provides automated failover for high availability, handles backups, patching, and scaling. Store database credentials securely in AWS Secrets Manager and inject them into the ECS tasks.
*   **Load Balancing (ALB):** Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across the ECS tasks running in different AZs. Configure HTTPS listeners using certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for secure connections.
*   **Static Asset Handling (S3/CloudFront):** Configure Django to collect static files (`collectstatic`). Upload these files to an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudFront (CDN) configured with the S3 bucket as an origin (using Origin Access Identity - OAI for security) to serve static assets efficiently and globally, reducing latency and load on the application servers.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Security Groups:** Implement strict security group rules to control traffic flow (e.g., ALB allows traffic from the internet on port 443, ECS tasks allow traffic only from the ALB, RDS allows traffic only from the ECS tasks).
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information like database passwords and API keys. Grant ECS tasks IAM permissions to retrieve these secrets.
    *   **IAM Roles:** Use specific IAM roles with least-privilege permissions for ECS Task Execution and ECS Task Roles.
    *   **WAF:** Attach AWS WAF to the ALB to protect against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS).
    *   **Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted at rest (RDS, S3) and in transit (using HTTPS via ALB/CloudFront).
*   **Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch):** Configure ECS tasks to send logs (application logs, Gunicorn logs) to AWS CloudWatch Logs. Set up CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms for key performance indicators (CPU/Memory utilization, RDS connections, ALB request counts, error rates) to trigger auto-scaling actions and notify operators of issues. Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use Terraform (as requested) to define and manage all infrastructure resources. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control for your infrastructure.
*   **CI/CD (Recommended):** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, or GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) to automate the process of building the Docker image, pushing it to ECR, and deploying updates to ECS.

## Estimated Monthly Costs

**
This is a rough estimate for a baseline deployment in `us-east-1` and will vary significantly based on traffic, specific instance/task sizes, data storage, and data transfer.
*   **ECS Fargate:** Assuming 2 tasks running continuously, each with 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB Memory.
    *   CPU: 2 * 0.5 vCPU * $0.04048/hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$29.55/month
    *   Memory: 2 * 1 GB * $0.004445/GB-hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$6.49/month
    *   **Total Fargate: ~$36/month** (Scales with usage)
*   **RDS PostgreSQL:** Using `db.t3.small` Multi-AZ instance.
    *   Instance: 2 * $0.0416/hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$60.74/month
    *   Storage: Assuming 20 GB GP2 storage * $0.115/GB-month = ~$2.30/month
    *   Backup Storage: (Estimate) ~$1/month
    *   **Total RDS: ~$64/month**
*   **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
    *   Hourly Cost: $0.0225/hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$16.43/month
    *   LCU Cost: Highly variable, estimate low usage ~5 LCUs = ~5 * $0.008/LCU-hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$29.20/month
    *   **Total ALB: ~$46/month**
*   **NAT Gateway:** Required for outbound traffic from private subnets (e.g., external API calls, package updates). Needs HA (one per AZ).
    *   Hourly Cost (2 Gateways): 2 * $0.045/hr * 730 hrs/month = ~$65.70/month
    *   Data Processing: Variable, estimate 50 GB = 50 * $0.045/GB = ~$2.25/month
    *   **Total NAT Gateway: ~$68/month**
*   **S3:** Assuming 5 GB static assets.
    *   Storage: 5 GB * $0.023/GB-month = ~$0.12/month
    *   Requests: Negligible for low traffic via CloudFront.
    *   **Total S3: <$1/month**
*   **CloudFront:** Assuming 100 GB data transfer out.
    *   Data Transfer: 100 GB * ~$0.085/GB = ~$8.50/month
    *   Requests: Negligible for moderate traffic.
    *   **Total CloudFront: ~$9/month**
*   **CloudWatch:** Assuming 5 GB logs ingested, standard metrics/alarms.
    *   Logs: 5 GB * $0.50/GB = $2.50/month (Ingestion) + Storage (low)
    *   Metrics/Alarms: Base usage often within free tier or low cost.
    *   **Total CloudWatch: ~$3-5/month**
*   **Route 53:**
    *   Hosted Zone: $0.50/month
    *   Queries: Low for standard traffic.
    *   **Total Route 53: ~$1/month**
*   **Secrets Manager:**
    *   1 Secret: $0.40/secret/month
    *   API Calls: Likely negligible.
    *   **Total Secrets Manager: ~$0.40/month**
*   **ECR:** Assuming 2 GB storage.
    *   Storage: 2 GB * $0.10/GB-month = $0.20/month
    *   **Total ECR: <$1/month**
*   **WAF:**
    *   WebACL: $5/month
    *   Rules: $1/rule/month (estimate 2 rules = $2)
    *   Requests: $0.60/million requests (estimate low = ~$1)
    *   **Total WAF: ~$8/month**
*   **Data Transfer Out (from ALB/EC2 if not via CloudFront):** Highly variable. Budget required if significant data served directly from ALB. CloudFront is generally more cost-effective for egress.
**Estimated Total Monthly Cost:** **~$235 - $300+** (Highly dependent on traffic, scaling activity, and NAT Gateway data processing). AWS Free Tier may reduce costs initially for some services.
